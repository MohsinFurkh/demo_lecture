---

## SLIDE 6: What is a Function? (5-6 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Functions are the building blocks of mathematics and computer science. But what exactly is a function?"

**Formal Definition:**
"Mathematically, a function f from a set A to a set B is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B such that for every element a in A, there is exactly one element b in B for which (a, b) is in the subset."

**Key Concepts:**
- "Domain: The complete set of all possible inputs"
- "Codomain: The set of all potential outputs"
- "Range: The set of all actual outputs that the function produces"

**Important Conditions:**
"Two critical conditions must be met:"
- "Total: Every element in the domain must be mapped to some element in the codomain"
- "Well-defined: No element in the domain can be mapped to more than one element in the codomain"

**Visual Examples:**
"Let's look at some examples. The first diagram shows a proper function - each input maps to exactly one output. The second shows what's NOT a function - one input maps to multiple outputs. The third also fails - some inputs have no output at all."

**Range vs Codomain:**
"Notice that the range is always a subset of the codomain. For example, if f(x) = x² with domain {1, 2, 3}, the codomain might be {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}, but the range is only {1, 4, 9}."

**Transition:**
"Now let's explore the different properties that functions can have."

---

## SLIDE 7: Function Properties (6-7 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Functions can have different properties that determine their behavior and applications. Let's examine three key properties: injective, surjective, and bijective."

**Injective (One-to-One):**
"An injective function maps every distinct input to a distinct output. Mathematically, if f(a) = f(b), then a must equal b."

**Visual Example:**
"Look at the first diagram - each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain. No two inputs share the same output."

**Example:**
"f(x) = 2x + 1 is injective because if 2a + 1 = 2b + 1, then a = b."

**Surjective (Onto):**
"A surjective function covers the entire codomain - every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image."

**Visual Example:**
"The second diagram shows multiple inputs can map to the same output, but every element in the codomain is covered."

**Example:**
"f(x) = x² for non-negative reals is surjective onto the non-negative reals."

**Bijective:**
"A bijective function is both injective and surjective - it's a perfect one-to-one correspondence."

**Visual Example:**
"The third diagram shows each input maps to exactly one output, and every output has exactly one input."

**Example:**
"f(x) = x + 3 is bijective because it's both injective and surjective."

**Transition:**
"Now let's explore how many functions of each type exist between finite sets."

## SLIDE 8: Counting Functions (5-6 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Given finite sets A and B with |A| = m and |B| = n, how many different functions can we create?"

**Total Functions:**
"The formula is n^m. Each of the m elements can map to any of the n elements. For example, if |A| = 3 and |B| = 2, we have 2³ = 8 total functions."

**Injective Functions:**
"We use the permutation formula P(n,m) = n!/(n-m)!. This is only possible if m ≤ n. For example, with |A| = 3 and |B| = 4, we have P(4,3) = 24 injective functions."

**Surjective Functions:**
"This is more complex, using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is the sum from k=0 to n of (-1)^k times the binomial coefficient of n choose k, times (n-k)^m."

**Example:**
"For |A| = 4 and |B| = 3, we get 3⁴ - 3×2⁴ + 3×1⁴ = 81 - 48 + 3 = 36 surjective functions."

**Bijective Functions:**
"These are simply n! and only possible when m = n. For |A| = 3 and |B| = 3, we have 3! = 6 bijective functions."

**Quick Reference Table:**
"Let's look at some examples. When |A| = 2 and |B| = 3, we have 9 total functions, 6 injective, no surjective, and no bijective functions."

**Transition:**
"Now let's explore how we can combine functions through composition."

---

## SLIDE 9: Function Composition (6-7 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Function composition allows us to build complex functions from simpler ones. Given f: A → B and g: B → C, we can create g∘f: A → C."

**Definition:**
"The composition (g∘f)(x) = g(f(x)). We first apply f, then apply g to the result."

**Interactive Example:**
"Let's work with f(x) = 2x + 3 and g(x) = x². The composition (g∘f)(x) = g(f(x)) = (2x + 3)² = 4x² + 12x + 9."

**Step-by-Step Process:**
"For x = 2: f(2) = 7, then g(7) = 49. So (g∘f)(2) = 49."

**Properties:**
"Composition has several important properties:"
- "Associativity: h∘(g∘f) = (h∘g)∘f"
- "Identity: f∘id = f and id∘f = f"
- "Composition of injective functions is injective"
- "Composition of surjective functions is surjective"
- "Non-commutative: g∘f ≠ f∘g in general"

**Detailed Example:**
"Let's verify the non-commutative property. (g∘f)(x) = 4x² + 12x + 9, but (f∘g)(x) = 2x² + 3. Clearly different!"

**Visual Flow:**
"The composition flow is: x → f(x) → g(f(x)) = (g∘f)(x) = y"

**Transition:**
"Now let's explore inverse functions, which are crucial for many applications."

---

## SLIDE 10: Inverse Functions (4-5 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"For bijective functions, we can define an inverse function that 'undoes' the original function."

**Definition:**
"For a bijective function f: X → Y, the inverse f⁻¹ satisfies:"
- "f⁻¹(f(x)) = x for all x in X"
- "f(f⁻¹(y)) = y for all y in Y"

**Example:**
"If f(x) = 2x + 3, then f⁻¹(y) = (y - 3)/2. We can verify: f(4) = 11 and f⁻¹(11) = 4."

**Finding Inverses:**
"The process is straightforward:"
1. "Replace f(x) with y"
2. "Swap x and y in the equation"
3. "Solve for y"
4. "Replace y with f⁻¹(x)"

**Properties:**
"Important properties of inverse functions:"
- "The inverse of a bijection is also a bijection"
- "(f⁻¹)⁻¹ = f"
- "(g∘f)⁻¹ = f⁻¹∘g⁻¹"
- "The graph of f⁻¹ is the reflection of f over y = x"

**Transition:**
"Now let's examine some key function types used in computer science."

## SLIDE 11: Key Function Types (4-5 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Let's explore some fundamental function types that appear frequently in computer science."

**Visual Representation:**
"The graph shows a perfect diagonal line - every input equals its output."

**Constant Function:**
"The constant function f(x) = c maps every element to the same constant value. This is useful in many algorithms and data structures."

**Visual Representation:**
"The graph shows a horizontal line at y = c."

**Applications:**
"These simple functions are building blocks for more complex operations. The identity function is crucial in matrix operations, while constant functions appear in initialization and default values."

**Transition:**
"Let's look at some specialized functions that are essential in programming."

## SLIDE 12: Floor & Ceiling Functions (4-5 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"Floor and ceiling functions are essential in computer science for handling real numbers in discrete contexts."

**Definitions:**
- "Floor ⌊x⌋: rounds down to the nearest integer"
- "Ceiling ⌈x⌉: rounds up to the nearest integer"

**Examples:**
"Let's look at some examples:"
- "⌊3.14⌋ = 3 and ⌈3.14⌉ = 4"
- "⌊-2.7⌋ = -3 and ⌈-2.7⌉ = -2"

**Key Properties:**
"Notice that for negative numbers, the floor function goes down (more negative), while ceiling goes up (less negative)."

**Visual Graph:**
"The graph shows the step-like behavior of these functions. Floor creates steps that jump at integer values, while ceiling creates steps that jump just before integer values."

**Applications:**
"These functions are crucial in:"
- "Array indexing and bounds checking"

**Transition:**
"Now let's examine the modulo function, which is fundamental in computer science."

---

## SLIDE 13: Modulo Function (4-5 minutes)

**Introduction:**
"The modulo function calculates the remainder of division and is essential in many computer science applications."

**Definition:**
"a mod b = remainder when a ÷ b"

**Examples:**
"Let's work through some examples:"
- "17 mod 5 = 2 (17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2)"
- "23 mod 7 = 2 (23 ÷ 7 = 3 remainder 2)"
- "8 mod 3 = 2 (8 ÷ 3 = 2 remainder 2)"

**Cyclic Nature:**
"The modulo function has a beautiful cyclic nature. The graph shows how the output cycles through values 0 to b-1."

**Applications:**
"Modulo is used in:"
- "Hash functions and hash tables"
- "Cryptography and encryption"
- "Circular arrays and buffers"
- "Clock arithmetic"
- "Random number generation"

**Properties:**
"Important properties include:"
- "(a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m"
- "(a × b) mod m = ((a mod m) × (b mod m)) mod m"

**Transition:**
"Now let's connect these mathematical concepts to real-world computer science applications."
